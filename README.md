# Personal Code_Study Journal of Ash Bergsma 

Code challenges... who doesn't love them? This is a collection of the code challenges I've solved for, mostly in Python and JavaScript. In each challenge I try to provide pseudo-code and explanations of what's going on and why. 

Often I will solve the questions using brute force, and then return to refine, refactor and improve the code later - if I can ðŸ’ª 

## Table of Contents: 

Challenges are *sort of* organized by their type. Sometimes it's hard to decide if a challenge is a number or an array challenge, etc. 

#### JavaScript Challenges: 

JS_challenges.js - Currently unorganized challenges, a grab bag

ðŸ§µ str_challenges.js - String challenges - reverse string, sum string, shifted words, etc. 

ðŸ”¢ num_challenges.js - Number (Integer) challenges - sum the positives, reverse num, etc.


#### Python Challenges: 

PY_challenges.py - Currently unorganized challenges, a grab bag

#### Installation: 

Right now there's nothing to install. I might add nodemon to the project to run JS code in the future. 

#### **Suggested VS Code extensions:**

I use the Better COmments extension from AmirH.A. to help color code my comments. If you have that installed you'll notice a visual organization to my comments in this repo.

## Notes

Using a tablet display I often take notes on subjects I don't readily know about. Navigate through those here.
