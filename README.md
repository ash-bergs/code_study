# Personal Code_Study Journal of Ash Bergsma 

Code challenges... who doesn't love them? This is a collection of the code challenges I've solved, mostly in Python and JavaScript. In each challenge I try to provide pseudo-code and explanations of what's going on. 

Often I will solve the questions using brute force, and then return to refine, refactor and improve the code later - if I can. 

## Table of Contents: 

1. JavaScript Challenges: 

- JS_challenges.js - Currently unorganized challenges, a grab bag
- str_challenges.js - String challenges - reverse string, sum string, shifted words, etc. 


2. Python Challenges: 

- PY_challenges.py - Currently unorganized challenges, a grab bag

## Installation: 

Right now there's nothing to install, really. I might add nodemon to the project to run JS code in the future.
