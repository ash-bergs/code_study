//* ‚ùì Spoonerize 

/* ------------------------------- description ------------------------------ */
/*
A spoonerism is a spoken phrase in which the first letters of two of the words are swapped around, often with amusing results.

In its most basic form a spoonerism is a two word phrase in which only the first letters of each word are swapped:

"not picking" --> "pot nicking"

Your task is to create a function that takes a string of two words, separated by a space: words and returns a spoonerism of those words in a string, as in the above example.

NOTE: All input strings will contain only two words. Spoonerisms can be more complex. For example, three-word phrases in which the first letters of the first and last words are swapped: "pack of lies" --> "lack of pies" or more than one letter from a word is swapped: "flat battery --> "bat flattery" You are NOT expected to account for these, or any other nuances involved in spoonerisms.

  // BTW THIS IS ALL DUMB
  // inject new values into singleWords 
  singleWords.splice(0, 1, newFirstWord); 
  singleWords.splice(singleWords.length - 1, 1, newLastWord)
  
  // return that array as a joined string 
  return singleWords.join(" ");

This solution is really brute force - it has 'beginner' written all over it
When originally solving for the problem I was assuming that there would be situations where the the string had more than 2 words
So when solving for the problem, I went through all these steps to preserve inner words 
! This is why reading all the directions in detail is important ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

//* REFACTORED SOLUTION 
// Because all input strings will ONLY contain 2 words, this function can be super simplified
//* And we can use destructuring! 

function refactoredSpoonerize(words) {
    // init the first and last variables, splitting the string 
    let [ first, last ] = words.split(" "); 
  
    // using destructuring 
    // the value of first is the result of concatenating last[0] (the first letter of last) + the first word minus the first letter (first.slice(1))
    // the same is done for the last letter - they are now mutated 
    [first, last] = [ last[0] + first.slice(1), first[0] + last.slice(1)]; 
    
    // return updated words as a joined string
    return [first, last].join(" ");
